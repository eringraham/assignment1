        <h2>The Perfect Cupcake</h2>
        
        <p>There are many, many recipes for Red Velvet Cupcakes out there these days.  I’m always experimenting with new formulas.  Sometimes I want more a darker, sexier cake with more chocolate.  Other times I want a bright red vanilla bean cake.  This recipe falls somewhere in the middle.  I’ve adapted this recipe from one of my new favorite cookbooks from the always delicious Citizen Cake in <strong>San Francisco.</strong></p>

        <h2>Preperations</h2>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oen to 325.  Sift together flour, baking powder and baking soda.  Add the kosher salt after sifting and set aside.  Measure out the buttermilk and red rood coloring.  Add the die to the buttermilk for easier incorporation later.</li>
              <li>Cream the butter and the sugar using an electric mixer, until the mixture is pale and fluffy.  Add the eggs one at a time, letting the eggs beat for 1 mintue in between additions.  Scrape down the bowl in between additions.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients alternately with the wet ingredients.  Start by adding one third of the flour mixture.  Mix just to incorporate.  Add half of the buttermilk.  Add another one third of the flour mixture.  Mix to incorporate.  Add the last half of buttermilk, followed by the last third of flour.</li>
            <li>Spoon into paper lined cupcake pans.  Check the cupcakes after 12 minutes.  <strong>Makes 12.</strong></li>
